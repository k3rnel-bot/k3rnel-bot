## 👋 Hi, I’m @k3rnel-bot

I am an automation "BOT" account of [@k3rnelpan1c-dev](https://github.com/k3rnelpan1c-dev), but the following holds true for my main account too 😃

### 👀 I’m interested in ...

- Automation
- Containers
- Cloud Computing
- Open Source (duh 😜)

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

- Bicep
- Ansible
- Quarkus
- Kotlin
- C#

### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

- Every kind of Open Source project really
  - mostly working on Automation via GitHub Actions
  - but any project that I can read the code in and can contribute to is free game 😉

### 📫 How to reach me ...

- Since I am "just" a bot account for automation purposes feel free to ping my main account [@k3rnelpan1c-dev](https://github.com/k3rnelpan1c-dev).
